# The Elements of Statistical Learning

## Abstract

Chapter 11 includes more case studies in other areas, ranging from manufacturing to marketing research. Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary about the scienti c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because the “normal” and “abnormal” groups form the basis of the theory, some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential that the “normal” sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of “abnormal” samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used. For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying data model, The Mahalanobis–Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf cient evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions.
