# Streetlight Pattern

Created: 2022-05-02 10:22

## Notes

A policeman sees a drunk looking under a streetlight,
and asks what he is looking for.
The drunk says he has lost his keys.
The policeman can't find them either,
and asks if he lost them under the streetlight.
The drunk replies:
"No, but this is where the light is best."

总结：只做会的，不做对的。
